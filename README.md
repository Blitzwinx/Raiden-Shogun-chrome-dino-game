A recreation of Chrome's Dino Runner game, made for learning purpose.

### What Iâ€™ve Learned from This Project

- **Game Logic Managing**: Used a single `GameManager` to centralize gameplay logic and access it globally.  
- **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**: Increased game speed over time (`gameSpeed`) to ramp up difficulty.  
- **Random Spawning**: Created an obstacle spawn system with randomized intervals.  
- **Ground Scrolling via Texture Offset**: Achieved infinite scrolling using shader/material offset instead of object movement.  
- **Persistent High Score System**: Stored and updated high scores using `PlayerPrefs` with live UI display.
